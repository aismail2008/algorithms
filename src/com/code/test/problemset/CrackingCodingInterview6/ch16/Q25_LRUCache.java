 * LRU Cache:
 * Design and build a "least recently used" cache, which evicts the least recently used item.
 * The cache should map from keys to values (allowing you to insert and retrieve a value associated
 * with a particular key) and be initialized with a max size. When it is full, it should evict the least
 * recently used item. You can assume the keys are integers and the values are strings.
