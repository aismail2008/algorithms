/**
 * Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets
 * Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
 * Output: True
 * Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
 * 0 < nums[i] < 10000.
 * Accepted

 *
 * ????
 * Time Complexity: O(k^{N-k} k!)
 * where NN is the length of nums, and kk is as given. As we skip additional zeroes in groups, naively we will make O(k!)O(k!) calls to search, then an additional O(k^{N-k})O(k
 * Nâˆ’k
 *  ) calls after every element of groups is nonzero.
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(N), the space used by recursive calls to search in our call stack.
