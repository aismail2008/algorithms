/**
 * Height Checker
 * <p>
 * Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.
 * <p>
 * Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
 * On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
 * On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
 * On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 0
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= heights.length <= 100
 * 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
 * <p>
