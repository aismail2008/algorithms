 *
 * Linked List Cycle:
 * Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
 *
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list,
 * we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to.
 * If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
